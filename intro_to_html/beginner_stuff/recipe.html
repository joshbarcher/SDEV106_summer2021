            <h2>Ingredients List</h2>

                <li>1 Tbsp Olive oil</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Butter</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 small purple cabbage</li>
                <li>2 medium avocado sliced</li>
                <li>2 roma tomatoes diced (optional)</li>
                <li>1/2 diced red onion</li>
                <li>1/2 bunch Cilantro longer stems removed</li>
                <li>4 oz 1 cup Cotija cheese, grated</li>
                <li>1 lime cut into 8 wedges to serve</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Line a large baking sheet with parchment or silicone liner. In a small dish, stir together
                    seasonings: 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper and
                    evenly sprinkle the seasoning mix over both sides of tilapia.</li>
                <li>Lightly drizzle fish with olive oil and top each piece with a dot of butter. Baked at 375˚F for
                    20-25 min. If you want it to get a little browned around the edges, you can broil for 3-5 minutes
                    at the end if desired.</li>
                <li>Combine all the Taco sauce ingredients: 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/3 cup Mayo, 2 Tbsp lime juice (from
                    1 medium lime), 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp Sriracha sauce, or to taste  in a medium bowl or a large
                    measuring cup and whisk together until well blended. It’s really fun and feels like dining out to
                    serve the sauce in a squeeze bottle like this one.</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </ol>
